= mmbase/example-webapp:latest

This e.g. is then based on `mmbase/tomcat` but also installs the 'example-webapp' (currently `1.9-SNAPSHOT`)

You may run it like so:
[source, base]
----
docker run --name mmbase-example-webapp -p 8080:8080 mmbase/example-webapp:latest
----

This will start the 'example' application on 8080. It is running on a non-persistent hsql database then.
