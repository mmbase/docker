= mmbase/build:latest

This is currently used to https://github.com/mmbase/mmbase/actions[build MMBase].

It contains the tools necessary for that. I.e. the build tools itself, but some tests also need the command line tools which some MMBase functionality needs when running, like

- ImageMagick
- FFMpeg

This means that this image is also useful when _running_ MMBase itself
