= MMBase Docker Images
:toc:

I created a few docker image to ease running MMBase in these new ages.


They are published at https://hub.docker.com/orgs/mmbase/repositories[hub.docker.com]


== mmbase/env:latest

This is currently used to https://github.com/mmbase/mmbase/actions[build MMBase].

It contains the tools necessary for that. I.e. the build tools itself, but some tests also need the command line tool which some of the MMBase functionality needs when running, like

- ImageMagick
- FFMpeg

This means that this image is also useful when _running_ MMBase.

== mmbase/tomcat:latest

This image is based on `mmbase/env` and sets up also a tomcat. Without any application though. It basically serves as a base image for other images containing actual applications

== mmbase/example-webapp:latest

This e.g. isthen based on `mmbase/tomcat` but also installs the 'example-webapp'.

You may run it like so:
[source, base]
----
docker run --name mmbase-example-webapp -p 8080:8080 mmbase/example-webapp:latest
----

This will start the 'example' application on 8080. It is running on a non-persistent hsql database then.
