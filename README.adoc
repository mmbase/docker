= MMBase Docker Image

This is currently used to https://github.com/mmbase/mmbase/actions[build MMBase].

It contains the tools necessary for that. I.e. the build tools itself, but some tests also need the command line some of the MMBase functionality needs when running, like

- ImageMagick
- FFMpeg


This means that this image probably is also useful when _running_ MMBase.


It is published at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mmbase/env[hub.docker.com]
