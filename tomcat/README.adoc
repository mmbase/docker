= mmbase/tomcat:latest

This image is based on `mmbase/env` and sets up also a tomcat. Without any application though. It basically serves as a base image for other images containing actual applications

E.g.

[source, Dockerfile]
----
from ghcr.io/mmbase/tomcat:latest


COPY target/oip-1.2-SNAPSHOT.war /tmp
----
