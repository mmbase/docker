= MMBase Docker Images
:toc:



I created a few docker images to ease running and building MMBase in these new ages.

They are/were published at https://hub.docker.com/orgs/mmbase/repositories[hub.docker.com], and currently also automatically (using gith actions) to https://github.com/orgs/mmbase/packages?repo_name=docker[ghcr.io]
